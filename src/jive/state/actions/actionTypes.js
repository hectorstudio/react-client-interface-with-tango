/*

Naming convention:

- FETCH_XXX           Remote asynchronous calls
- FETCH_XXX_SUCCESS   Data returned from remote calls (typically created in .then(json => ...))
- FETCH_XXX_FAILED    Failure to retrieve remote data (typically created in .catch(err => ...))
- SET_XXX             Set local state synchronously

Avoid GET_XXX in order not to confuse selectors and action creators.
