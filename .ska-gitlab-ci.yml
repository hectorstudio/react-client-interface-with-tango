# GitLab CI in conjunction with GitLab Runner can use Docker Engine to test and build any application.
# Docker, when used with GitLab CI, runs each job in a separate and isolated container using the predefined image that is set up in .gitlab-ci.yml.
# In this case we use the latest node docker image to build and test this project.
image: node:alpine

# Docker in Docker (dind) allows this CI file to be run locally (assuming you have docker installed).
# Note this relies on a number of system variables on the local system. 
# TODO: Find an elegant way of setting these in a robust way without exposing them in a public file.

  # cache is used to specify a list of files and directories which should be cached between jobs. You can only use paths that are within the project workspace.

# before_script is used to define the command that should be run before all jobs, including deploy jobs, but after the restoration of artifacts.
# This can be an array or a multi-line string. In this case node install will install all our dependencies including the scripts

#   - npm ci

# stages is used to define the workflow. So in this example we have a 'test' stage followed by a 'deploy' stage.  What this means is first any jobs with a stage of test are
# run. Jobs of the same stage  may be run in parallel. If they succeed and then any jobs with a stage of 'deploy' are run.
#
# If we hadn't defined any stages then we could still have used the defaults of 'build' 'test' and 'deploy' for defining the jobs.
#
# (if you don't specify a stage in the job then it is assumed to be part of the 'test' stage)
stages:
  - dependencies
  - test
  - deploy

# We need to ensure that the files from any previous build have been removed before we start otherwise we could pick up
# old build artifacts

# The YAML file defines a set of jobs with constraints stating when they should be run.
# You can specify an unlimited number of jobs which are defined as top-level elements with an arbitrary name and always have to contain at least the script clause.
# In this case we have only the test job which produce an artifacts (it must be placed into a directory called "public")
# It is also specified that only the master branch will be subject of this job.
